Sample booter for XNU
=====================
- Requires 'mkimage' from u-boot to generate uImage.
- Builds using arm-none-eabi toolchain for ARMv7 architecture.
- Default target is ARM RealView PB-A8 board configuration.
- Can boot from u-boot if you modify config.mk for your board configuration.
- Maybe sort of buggy.
- Mach kernel should be in image3 form as 'mach.img3', type is 'krnl', just have DATA and TYPE
  in the Image3 file.
- This bootloader isn't perfect.
- To boot this bootloader:
  qemu-system-arm -M realview-pb-a8 -m 512 -serial stdio -kernel SampleBooter.elf.uImage -semihosting
